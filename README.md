Multi-Tier-Flask-App-with-Gunicorn-Nginx-PostgreSQL-and-Systemd-using-Ansible

This project demonstrates the automated deployment of a production-grade multi-tier Flask application using Ansible. It integrates key components of modern web architecture by combining a Python-based Flask app served via Gunicorn (a WSGI HTTP server), reverse-proxied through Nginx for efficient request handling and static content delivery, and backed by PostgreSQL for persistent data storage. Systemd is used to manage both application and database services, ensuring that everything starts automatically on boot and runs reliably. The entire stack is provisioned and configured using Ansible playbooks, enabling repeatable, scalable deployments with minimal manual intervention. This project aims to give DevOps practitioners hands-on experience in infrastructure-as-code, service orchestration, and full-stack deployment on a single Ubuntu machine, reinforcing real-world automation practices and production-readiness for Python web applications.
